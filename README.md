## Purpose

- This website is my personal portfolio where I can not only demonstrate my skillset, but also talk about my experiences and past projects that have brought me to where I am now.
- I think there's a beauty in not just making a portfolio, but projects in general. Each project I make is a step towards my goal of learning more about the constantly expanding field of web development and software engineering.

## Lessons Learned
<p>
I had made my first portfolio back in January, so it felt like it was an odd decision to decide to make a new one so soon (within two months). But with the amount of knowledge I gained in those short two months, I felt like I could do so much better than what I currently had. That inspired my decision to create a new portfolio from scratch that utilized my new web development and design knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
I had tried to work with Anime.js and a package called Splt.js, but for some reason I could not get them to work properly. I stuck with GSAP for animations and kept the tech pretty vanilla in terms of new packages. I really struggled with making the page-to-page transitions seamless. I think that in the future, I would opt to find a cleaner solution than the one I implemented. It is a bit finnicky so it is definitely not the preferred method. 
</p>
<p>
I also got the opportunity to work with EmailJS which is a package/service that allows you to send emails without any backend code. It was awesome to work with, but I don't know if I'll find another use case for it. Instead of displaying my email and using social links, I wanted to incorporate a contact form that actually sends an email to my inbox. It worked perfectly and I am quite happy with the results. I think I should definitely try to look into using useReducer for forms that have a lot of input states that need to be tracked. I could also look into consolidating the five input states into one state and have the value be an object. Then use the spread operator to update the state object values.
